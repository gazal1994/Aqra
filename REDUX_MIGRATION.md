# Redux Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the Aqra React Native app from Context API to Redux for better state management, as requested by the user.

## âœ… Completed Redux Components

### 1. Redux Store Structure
- **Store Configuration** (`src/store/index.ts`)
  - Configured with Redux Toolkit
  - Redux Persist for auth and app state
  - TypeScript support with proper typing

- **Typed Hooks** (`src/store/hooks.ts`)
  - `useAppDispatch` and `useAppSelector` with proper TypeScript typing

### 2. Redux Slices

#### Auth Slice (`src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`)
- **State Management**: User authentication, profile, tokens
- **Async Thunks**: 
  - `loginUser` - Handle user login
  - `registerUser` - Handle user registration  
  - `logoutUser` - Handle user logout
  - `updateUserProfile` - Update user profile
  - `loadStoredAuth` - Load stored authentication state
- **Features**: Token refresh, auto-logout on token expiry, persistent storage

#### App Slice (`src/store/slices/appSlice.ts`)
- **State Management**: App-wide settings and preferences
- **Features**:
  - Theme management (light/dark)
  - Language settings
  - Onboarding completion tracking
  - Notification preferences
  - Search filters
  - Offline status
  - Unread notification counts

#### Teachers Slice (`src/store/slices/teachersSlice.ts`)
- **State Management**: Teacher search and management
- **Async Thunks**:
  - `searchTeachers` - Search for teachers with filters
- **Features**:
  - Teacher search results with pagination
  - Favorite teachers management
  - Search filters (subject, location, price range, etc.)
  - Cached teacher details

#### Requests Slice (`src/store/slices/requestsSlice.ts`)
- **State Management**: Lesson request management
- **Async Thunks**:
  - `createLessonRequest` - Create new lesson request
  - `fetchReceivedRequests` - Get requests for teachers
  - `fetchSentRequests` - Get requests from students
  - `acceptRequest` - Accept lesson request
  - `rejectRequest` - Reject lesson request
- **Features**:
  - Separate handling of sent vs received requests
  - Request status updates
  - Pagination support

#### Messages Slice (`src/store/slices/messagesSlice.ts`)
- **State Management**: Chat and messaging system
- **Async Thunks**:
  - `fetchChatRooms` - Get user's chat rooms
  - `fetchMessages` - Get messages for a room
  - `sendMessage` - Send new message
  - `markMessagesAsRead` - Mark messages as read
  - `createChatRoom` - Create new chat room
- **Features**:
  - Real-time message handling
  - Unread message tracking
  - Typing indicators
  - Message pagination

### 3. Updated Components

#### App Component (`App.tsx`)
- Replaced Context providers with Redux Provider
- Added Redux Persist integration
- Proper provider hierarchy maintained

#### Root Navigator (`src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`)
- Updated to use Redux selectors instead of local state
- Integrated with auth and app slices
- Proper loading state handling

#### Onboarding Screen (`src/screens/OnboardingScreen.tsx`)
- Updated to dispatch Redux actions
- Proper integration with app slice

#### Authentication Screens
- **Login Screen**: Updated to use Redux login action
- **Register Screen**: Updated to use Redux register action
- Proper error handling with Redux state

## ðŸ”§ Technical Features

### Redux Toolkit Integration
- Modern Redux patterns with `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`
- Immutable state updates with Immer
- Built-in error handling and loading states
- TypeScript support throughout

### Persistence Strategy
- **Persisted**: Auth state (user, tokens), App preferences (theme, language)
- **Not Persisted**: Teachers, Requests, Messages (fetched fresh on app start)
- Uses AsyncStorage for React Native compatibility

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling in all async thunks
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper error state management

### Performance Optimizations
- Selective persistence to reduce storage usage
- Efficient state updates with normalized data structures
- Proper memoization opportunities with Redux selectors

## ðŸš€ Migration Benefits

1. **Better State Management**: Centralized, predictable state updates
2. **Developer Experience**: Redux DevTools support, time-travel debugging
3. **Scalability**: Easier to manage complex state as app grows
4. **Testing**: More testable than Context API patterns
5. **Performance**: Better re-render optimization opportunities
6. **Persistence**: Granular control over what state persists

## ðŸ“± App Features Supported

### Authentication System
- Login/Register/Logout
- Profile management
- Token refresh
- Persistent login state

### Teacher Discovery
- Search with multiple filters
- Favorites management
- Teacher profiles
- Pagination

### Lesson Requests
- Create requests
- Accept/Reject requests
- Request status tracking
- Separate student/teacher views

### Messaging System
